/**
 * Simple Selection sort method
 *
 * The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted, which
 * is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and the sublist of items
 * remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is
 * empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the
 * smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging
 * (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the
 * sublist boundaries one element to the right.
